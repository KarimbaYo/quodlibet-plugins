# Quodlibet Plugins üõ†Ô∏è

My personal plugins for QuodLibet music software.

## Descriptions

### /events/

#### Conjunction

Filter your paned browser with multiple selections, using a **logical AND** instead of the default logical OR ; see [#4765](https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/4765).  
Ideal for multi-tagged songs (`<genre>`, `<grouping>`, `<language>`,etc).  
A button is added at the right hand top of the paned browser to switch between `AND` (`&`) and `OR` (`||`) logic.

#### WaveformSeekbar2

An improved version of the original **WaveformSeekbar** plugin, with two additional options:
* Displays only _half of the waveform_ (usually symmetrical, which is 50% wasted space)
* Applying _compression to the curve_ to better visualize quiet sounds (useful for pieces with high dynamics, such as classical music).

### /editing/

#### RenamingTreeView

View your file tree when renaming your library

#### RenamingPathPrune

For path components containing multiple values (tags separated by commas) while renaming files, this plugin intelligently selects a single value based on defined preference and avoidance rules.


## Installing

* Copy the `.py` files into your personal QuodLibet plugins folder (usually `~/.config/quodlibet/plugins/` on Linux and Mac) with the corresponding subfolder (`editing`, `events`, `songsmenu`, etc.)  
* Relaunch Quodlibet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

Some plugins use unconventionnal methods and deeply modify QuodLibet's code when active.  
They are therefore very dependent on a software version (v4.7.1 at the moment) and _may cause unexpected behavior_ with other versions: **use them at your own risk!**  
If you encounter any problems, simply delete the file from your plugins folder.
